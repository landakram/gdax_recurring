Usage: hodl-cli [OPTIONS]

  Dollar-cost averaging for crypto on the command line using Coinbase Pro.

  When run, hodl-cli will check whether a deposit needs to be made and, if
  so, initiate the deposit using a linked bank account.

  Then, if there is enough available fiat in the Pro account, hodl-cli will
  buy currencies using the specified fiat amount, given a user-specified
  asset allocation. Currencies are traded at market price at the time the
  script is run.

  hodl-cli is meant to be run as a cron. The cron can be run at any interval
  less than the `interval` -- I recommend daily. The script will ensure that
  deposits and buys are only made every `interval` days irrespective of how
  often it is run. This is done by searching account  history in the past
  `interval` days and ensuring that no deposit or buy for a given amount has
  been executed.

  hodl-cli does *not* protect against concurrency issues. Please make sure
  that only one instance of hodl-cli is running at a time to prevent
  duplicate deposits and buys (PRs welcome).

  In addition to the CLI options, a few environment variables must be
  present:

      COINBASE_PRO_API_KEY
      COINBASE_PRO_API_SECRET
      COINBASE_PRO_PASSPHRASE

  Installation:

      pip install hodl-cli

  Example usage:

      export COINBASE_PRO_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
      export COINBASE_PRO_API_SECRET=<your_api_secret>
      export COINBASE_PRO_PASSPHRASE=<your_passphrase>
      hodl-cli -i 15 -d 100.00 -b 95.00 -a LTC 0.10 -a ETH 0.60 -a BTC 0.30

  Explanation:

      The above invocation will deposit $100.00 every 15 days. In addition,
      if the Pro account has $95.00 available to trade, $95.00 will used to
      buy other currencies as follows:

      10% will be used to buy LTC
      60% will be used to buy ETH
      30% will be used to buy BTC

  -a, --allocation-percentage <TEXT DECIMAL>...
                                  A currency and the percentage of available
